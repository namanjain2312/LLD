Given a shopping cart with products and coupons and caluclate the net price after applying
coupons on products
Coupons can be of different types with certain condiions
1>N% off that is 10 % off on all the items
2>P% off on the next items
3>D% off on Nth item Of type T

Sequentially want to apply the coupns on the cart anf get the total amount

So basically in a nutshell we want to apply coupons to certain product and could select the logic
predefined basis weather a coupon could be applied on the product  or not

So its basically somewhat similar to a decorator pattern where we could apply decoration to one product
then again decorate that product wiht another thing then again and then again and so on
