Builder Design Pattern
1>Let say i have an student class which have about 50+ fields in it , now only rollnumber field
is compulsary rest we can left blank
Now in this case hoe to create constuctor of student calss , because one cinsturucotr could have
name and roll number , one could have name last name and roll number etc
So number of s=contructor becomes huges

That where builder design pattern come into the picture


Disavantage of Builder Design Pattern
1>Code get duplicated as we duplicate the code in Student Calss and as well as in StudentBuilder class




1>Step by step object creation
2>StringBuilder can be either an interfcaec or an abtract class



Differnece Between Decorator Design Pattern and Builder Pattern
