Builder Design Pattern
1>Let say i have an student class which have about 50+ fields in it , now only rollnumber field
is compulsary rest we can left blank
Now in this case hoe to create constuctor of student calss , because one cinsturucotr could have
name and roll number , one could have name last name and roll number etc
So number of s=contructor becomes huges

That where builder design pattern come into the picture


Disavantage of Builder Design Pattern
1>Code get duplicated as we duplicate the code in Student Calss and as well as in StudentBuilder class




1>Step by step object creation
2>StringBuilder can be either an interfcaec or an abtract class



Differnece Between Decorator Design Pattern and Builder Pattern

Feature	        Decorator Pattern	                                        Builder Pattern
Purpose	        Dynamically adds behavior or responsibilities to an object	Separates object construction from its representation
Used When	    You want to add features to objects without modifying their You want to build a complex object step by step
                code
Focus	        Enhancing or wrapping existing objects	                    Constructing a full object with optional parameters
Design Type	    Structural Pattern	                                        Creational Pattern
Example Use Case:Making mushroom cheese pizza via base pizza	            Building a Pizza object with either mushroom or Cheese topping , but not both
Key Concept	    Composition of behaviors via wrapping	                    Controlled step-by-step object creation
Object Creation	Works on already created objects	                        Used during object creation phase
