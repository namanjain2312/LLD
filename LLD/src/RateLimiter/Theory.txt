1>Fixed Window
Variable Used
    a>WindowSize
    b>maxRequestAllowed
    c>ConcurrentHashMap<String, WindowDetails> //Ip address vs each window ip curr window status details
    d>WindowDetails
        Integer windowStartTime
        Integer requestCountInCurrWindow

Request will comes to us , we will allow only a preset number of request in that window

2>Sliding Window
Variable Used
    a>WindowSize
    b>maxRequestAllowed
    c>ConcurrentHashMap<String, ConcurrentLinkedDeque<Long>> userMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    //Ip Address vs Deque<TimeInMillis>
    d>So basicallt we will check our dequeue size and the last time of the request in deque - the current time ,
    if dequeu size is == maxAllowedRequest and so on and so for
Request will comes to us , we will allow only a preset number of request in that sliding window

3>Token Bucket
