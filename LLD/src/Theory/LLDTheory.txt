1>Mutable vs Non-Mutable (Immutable)
    Aspect	        Mutable	                                Immutable (Non-Mutable)
    Definition	    Can be changed after creation	        Cannot be changed once created
    State	        Internal state can be modified	        Internal state remains constant
    Examples in     StringBuilder, ArrayList, HashMap	    String, Integer, LocalDate
    Java
    Thread-Safety	Not inherently thread-safe	            Usually thread-safe because the state doesn’t change
    Performance	    Better when frequent modifications      Safer and often better for concurrent operations
                    are needed
    Use Case	    Caching, buffers, real-time state       Keys in HashMap, functional programming, multi-threading
                    updates
    Copy Behavior	Can be shared with caution	            Usually safe to share without concern

1>Weather to use a userId or User object in Post and answer class
Answer - Always use User as it is easy to understand and objects in java are Mutabale , so we do not copy
        the User object but instead we store its pointing/reference , thus no extra memory and easy to
        store
