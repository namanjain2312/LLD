1>Extends vs Implements
    Extends
    a>Used for class inheritance
    b>Only one class could be inherited at a time
    c>Method could be declared in the parent class and implemeted in parent class as well and
      could directly be used by child

    Implements
    a>Used for interface implementation
    b>Multiple interfaces could be imlplemented by a class at a time
    c>Methods could only be declrard in the base class and could not be implemented (certain exception)
    d>So interface is by default public abstract void
    e>By default the methods in the interface are public abstract void
    c>Class implementing an interface must implement all the methods declared in the base interface

2>Abtract Keyword
    a>Abstract Method
        1>A method without a body
        2>Must be overridden by a subclass
    b>Abstract Class
        1>A class that may contain abstract methods, but also can have implemented methods.
        2>You cannot instantiate an abstract class directly.

3>Abstract Class vs Interface
    Difference
    a>Abstract class could have both abstract and concrete mehtods
    b>ALl methods in interface are explicitly public
    c>Constuctor could be created for abtract class
    d>A class could inherit only one abstract class but could implement multipl interface

4>Final Keyword
    a>The final keyword in Java is used to declare constants and enforce immutability or unchangeability.
    b>Final Variable → Cannot be changed once assigned
    c>Final Method → Cannot be overridden
    d>Final Class → Cannot be extended (inherited)
    e>Final Parameter → Cannot be modified inside method
