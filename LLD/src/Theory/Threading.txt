1>Synchronized
    The synchronized keyword in Java is used to prevent concurrent access to critical
    sections of code, ensuring thread safety.
    synchronized ensures that only one thread can access that code block or method at a time.
    synchronized (someSharedObject) {
        // critical section
    }
